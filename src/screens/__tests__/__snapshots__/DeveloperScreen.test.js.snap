      Before beginning my apprenticeship I felt that I had reached a wall in my ability to improve in my previous job, and I was looking for a position where I could continuously learn. At Asda I have been introduced to a lot of new experiences, and have been given the opportunity to continue to improve my skills, and learn about new technologies.

      I want to continue to work as a developer to continue this learning and to be able to make applications that people will enjoy using. In addition I want to work towards encouraging other females to get into technology and specifically development, as I feel that when I was considering career options, it wasn't something that I was made aware of, despite my keen interest in technology.
